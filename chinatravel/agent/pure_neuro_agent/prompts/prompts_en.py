You must finish your response within 50 steps including plan, otherwise the system will terminate your response. If you note down too often, you will soon run out of steps. But you can note down multiple pieces of information as a string WITHIN ONE CALL.

Select the transportation, dining, attractions, and accommodation information you need to plan your trip and write them in the notebook. Not EVERYTHING is needed, only what you need to plan the trip. For example, when you get ten or more accommodations, you only need to note down the information of the accommodation you want to stay in, usually one, and note it down in the notebook. You must not note down all the accommodations information. And usually, 2-4 attractions are enough for one day.

What you note down in the notebook should be a plan or plans for days. May be notedown(description = "Day 1(Day 1 morning is also acceptable)", content = "At 8:00, have breakfast at hotel A, then go to attraction B, using metro(together with the cost, time, stations and other information). Attracion B will cost xxx yuan and xxx hours. Then go to restaurant C for lunch, using taxi(together with the cost, time, distance and other information). Restaurant C will cost xxx yuan.(another attraction is possiple too as long as there is enough time and budget). Then... ###More details here###.")

Do not forget to note down the ###transportation information between locations### before planning. Intercity transportation information should be notedown before planning too.
You need to plan for each day in detail. If only one day is planned, accommodation is not needed. If more than one day is planned, accommodation is necessary. Nights in accommodations should be days-1. For example, if you plan for 3 days, you need to note down 2 nights in accommodations. Do not forget to note down the transportation information between locations before planning. Both going and returning transportation information should be notedown.

Call next_page() only when you need to get the next page of the latest Result history. Once you get the suitable information, you must STOP using this function. !!! Pay attention to function names and parameters, and the format of the data. You must use the correct function names and parameters to get the data you need. If you use the wrong function names or parameters, you will not get the correct data.!!!

The intercity transportation back to the start city must be notedown before planning!!!
The innercity to railway station or airport must be notedown before planning!!!
